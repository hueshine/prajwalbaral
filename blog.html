                    <span>Carbon pricing has a critical role to play in combating climate change but scaling it up will take time, says Prajwal Baral.</span>
                    <p>Carbon pricing has become a hotly discussed topic among political, business, and academic experts who believe it will accomplish the 
                        critical goal of net-zero carbon emissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the real world, however, carbon pricing has not achieved anything approaching wide use. Less than a quarter of global carbon emissions 
                        is currently covered by existing carbon pricing initiatives – even as a continued rise in global emissions puts the planet in peril.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Does this mean we stop the pursuit of putting a price on carbon? Absolutely not. It must still play a critical role in our collective 
                        ambition towards a zero-carbon economy because polluters must be made liable to pay. However, we must be practical about its limitations 
                        and focus on complementary tools where needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I see four critical areas that policy makers and the private sector should be familiar with if they want carbon pricing to work and scale up.
                    </p>

                        Support government and explore alternative tools
                    </h4>
                    <p>First, we need to support "starter countries" — governments that are early on in the process of understanding carbon pricing — while at the same 
                        time encourage them to apply alternative tools in the interim.
